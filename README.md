## Overview

LexGuard provides legal guidance, procedural steps, and emergency alerts for women and minorities facing domestic violence, assault, and other legal challenges. It ensures timely, AI-driven legal assistance.


## Inspiration

Every day, countless women and marginalized individuals face legal challenges—domestic violence, workplace harassment, discrimination—without knowing their rights or the legal steps they can take. LexGuard is an AI-powered legal advisor designed to bridge this gap by offering instant, accessible, and reliable legal guidance.

Powered by Gemini AI, LexGuard provides personalized legal resources, step-by-step guidance on legal procedures, and emergency support to those in vulnerable situations. With a user-specific profile, it enables users to alert emergency contacts instantly in crisis situations, ensuring rapid response and safety.

Unlike generic legal aid platforms, LexGuard tailors advice based on individual cases, making legal protection accessible, actionable, and empowering. By leveraging AI, we aim to democratize legal awareness, ensuring that no one is left uninformed or unprotected.

LexGuard isn't just an app—it’s a lifeline, a shield, and a guide.
